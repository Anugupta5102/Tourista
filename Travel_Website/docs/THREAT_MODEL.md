# Authentication System Threat Model

## Assets Protected
- User credentials
- Personal data
- Session tokens

## Potential Threats
| Threat | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Brute force attacks | Rate limiting | Implemented |
| Session hijacking | HTTP-only cookies | Implemented | 
| CSRF | SameSite cookies | Implemented |
| XSS | Input sanitization | Partial |
| Credential stuffing | Password complexity | Implemented |
| Phishing | User education | Needed |

## Monitoring Recommendations
1. Log all authentication attempts
2. Alert on multiple failed logins
3. Monitor token generation rate
4. Track password reset requests

## Future Improvements
- Implement multi-factor authentication
- Add suspicious activity detection
- Regular security audits
